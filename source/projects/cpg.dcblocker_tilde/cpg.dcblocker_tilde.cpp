	MIN_DESCRIPTION {	"Filter out DC offset. "
						"The DC offset or <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_bias'>DC bias</a>, is removed by applying a first-order highpass filter to the input."
						"<br/><br/>"
						"This first-order highpass filter algorithm is used pretty much everywhere (STK, ChucK, RTCMix, SuperCollider, Max, Pd, etc),"
						"with the difference equation:"
						"<br/><br/>"
						"	y(n) = (1 * x(n))  +  (-1 * x(n-1))  -  (-0.9997 * y(n-1))  ,  n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..."
						"<br/><br/>"
						"which can be simplified to:"
						"<br/><br/>"
						"	y(n) = x(n) - x(n-1) + (0.9997 * y(n-1))"
						"<br/><br/>"
						"and thus characterized by the Z-transform:"
						"<br/><br/>"
						"	Y(z) = X(z)  -  X(z) * z^(-1)  +  Y(z) * 0.9997 * z^(-1)"
						"<br/><br/>"
						"meaning the transfer function is:"
						"<br/><br/>"
						"	H(z) = [1  -  z^(-1)]  /  [1  +  0.9997 * z^(-1)]"
						"<br/><br/>"
						"and resulting in the frequency response:"
						"<br/><br/>"
						"	H( e^(i*omega*T) ) = [1  -  e^(-i * omega * T)]  /  [1  +  0.9997 * e^(-i * omega * T)]"
						"<br/><br/>"
						"where $i$ is the sqrt(-1), e is Euler's log base, T is the sampling interval, and omega is 2*pi*frequency."
						"<br/><br/>"
						"In Max, it usually shows up simply as [biquad~ 1.0 -1.0 0.0 -0.9997 0.0]."
						"In other places it usually shows up with the feedback coefficient set to -0.995"
						"(e.g in SuperCollider and in [JOS, 2007, pp 273])."
						"The higher coefficient is desirable so as to not attenuate lowish frequencies in the spectrum,"
						"but with the caveat that it also won't respond as quickly to varying amounts DC Offset."
						"<br/><br/>"
						"The power is attenuated by -3 dB at a normalized frequency of 0.1612 * pi @ 0.9997."
						"At fs=44100 this translates to cf = 22050 * 0.1612 = 3554.46 Hz."
						"<br/><br/>"
						"The power is attenuated by -3 dB at a normalized frequency of 0.1604 * pi @ 0.995."
						"At fs=44100 this translates to cf = 22050 * 0.1604 = 3536.82 Hz."
						"<br/><br/>"
						"For reference, in this last case, the power is attenuated by -6 db (magnitude attenuated by -12 dB) @ 0.0798 * pi,"
						"which at fs=44100 translates to 1759.59 Hz."
